# IoT-Based Portable Biomedical Kit for Hepatitis and Jaundice Detection

A non-invasive, IoT-enabled biomedical device developed for the early detection and monitoring of liver diseases such as **hepatitis** and **jaundice**. This project uses **spectroscopy and optical sensors** to quantitatively assess bilirubin levels in urine, offering a portable and user-friendly alternative to traditional blood tests.

## 🔍 Overview

The system is designed to provide accurate, real-time bilirubin level analysis and transmit the results securely via IoT to a mobile application for health monitoring and personalized dietary advice.

## 🎯 Features

- 🧪 Non-invasive bilirubin detection using spectroscopy
- 📲 IoT integration for remote monitoring and alerts
- 📈 Real-time data visualization on mobile apps
- 🧠 Built-in health advice and tracking based on readings
- 💡 Low-cost, portable, and easy-to-use design

## 💰 Funding

- **INR 25,000** funded by the Centre for Sponsored Research and Consultancy, Anna University.

## 🧰 Technologies Used

- Optical sensors for bilirubin detection
- Microcontroller (Used : PIC-32)
- Wi-Fi/Bluetooth for IoT data transmission
- Mobile App (Android/iOS) integration
- Data analytics for health recommendations

## 📱 System Workflow

1. **Urine sample** is tested using the optical sensor module.
2. **Spectroscopy** readings are converted to digital bilirubin levels.
3. **Microcontroller** transmits data via Wi-Fi/Bluetooth to the mobile app.
4. **App dashboard** displays health metrics and suggestions.
5. **Cloud (optional)** for long-term storage and doctor access.

## 📈 Applications

- Liver disease screening (hepatitis, jaundice)
- Rural healthcare and home diagnostics
- Smart health monitoring systems
